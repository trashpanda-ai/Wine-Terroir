2020,92,Drink or hold,"As with the past several vintages, 2020 saw a very good growing season, with a wet, late winter and early spring helping to build up water reserves for the exceptionally hot summer.

2019,93,Drink or hold,"The summer heat stressed the vines and lowered the yields, but the fruit left to harvest was of premium quality. Red varieties benefited from the warm weather, with Cabernet Franc delivering ripe but balanced wines. For the whites, both Sauvignon Blanc and Chenin Blanc have naturally high acidities, yielding greater harmony. Not many sweet wines were produced",France,Loire,Cabernet Franc
2018,92,Drink or hold,"One of the largest crops of the decade, with favorable weather conditions throughout the year yielding concentrated wines that are a bit lower in acidity than usual.

2017,90,Drink or hold,"A solid follow-up to the 2015 and 2016 duo, with lower yields due to a severe spring frost.

2015,90,Drink or hold,"Finally, a solid vintage, easily the best since 2010. Some early spring rains hampered flowering in Sancerre, but growing season was hot and dry. Late-season rains caused thin-skinned varieties such as Gamay to face disease pressures; acidities slightly lower than usual. Cabernet Franc ripened well; Chenin Blanc excelled with both dry and sweet versions",France,Loire,Cabernet Franc
2014,87,Drink or hold,"Generally gray and rainy midsummer season led to uneven ripening throughout the valley, putting a premium on viticulture; hail hit Vouvray, cutting yields. September was ideal, saving the vintage. Mélon, Cabernet Franc were better-performing grapes; dry Chenin succeeded somewhat, sweet wines much less so",France,Loire,Cabernet Franc

Overall, another difficult year, putting a premium on viticulture and selection in the winery. Expect scattered success at best",France,Loire,Cabernet Franc
2012,84,Drink,"A difficult year. April frosts and a cold, rainy weather pattern through July led to lower yields and uneven ripening; an October storm in the western and central part of the valley caused more problems. Sancerre and Pouilly-Fumé relatively spared",France,Loire,Cabernet Franc

2020,94,Drink or hold,"As with the past several vintages, 2020 saw a very good growing season, with a wet, late winter and early spring helping to build up water reserves for the exceptionally hot summer. Chenin Blancs, both dry and sweet, look especially promising; Cabernet Francs are ripe but retain freshness; Sauvignon Blancs that weren’t harvested too late show good precision",France,Loire,Chenin Blanc
2019,94,Drink or hold,"The summer heat stressed the vines and lowered the yields, but the fruit left to harvest was of premium quality. Red varieties benefited from the warm weather, with Cabernet Franc delivering ripe but balanced wines. For the whites, both Sauvignon Blanc and Chenin Blanc have naturally high acidities, yielding greater harmony. Not many sweet wines were produced",France,Loire,Chenin Blanc
2018,93,Drink or hold,"One of the largest crops of the decade, with favorable weather conditions throughout the year yielding concentrated wines that are a bit lower in acidity than usual. Chenin Blanc and red varieties did very well, while a streak of rain affected areas producing Sauvignon Blanc, causing some disease pressure; very little noble rot, but good ripeness overall",France,Loire,Chenin Blanc
2017,92,Drink or hold,"A solid follow-up to the 2015 and 2016 duo, with lower yields due to a severe spring frost. The ensuing growing season was relatively dry and warm, running one to two weeks early through harvest, and scattered rains in the second half of July helped to freshen the vines. Whites are pure and precise, reds are fresh and charming",France,Loire,Chenin Blanc
2016,94,Drink or hold,"A step ahead of 2015 and different in style. A severe spring frost cut the crop by as much as 50 percent. May through July was rainy, but then draught conditions arrived and persisted through the harvest. Luckily temperatures were not too hot, especially through harvest. Wines have fresher acidity than 2015. Very solid vintage, with some exceptional sweet wines",France,Loire,Chenin Blanc
2015,92,Drink or hold,"Finally, a solid vintage, easily the best since 2010. Some early spring rains hampered flowering in Sancerre, but growing season was hot and dry. Late-season rains caused thin-skinned varieties such as Gamay to face disease pressures; acidities slightly lower than usual. Cabernet Franc ripened well; Chenin Blanc excelled with both dry and sweet versions",France,Loire,Chenin Blanc
2014,86,Drink or hold,"Generally gray and rainy midsummer season led to uneven ripening throughout the valley, putting a premium on viticulture; hail hit Vouvray, cutting yields. September was ideal, saving the vintage. Mélon, Cabernet Franc were better-performing grapes; dry Chenin succeeded somewhat, sweet wines much less so",France,Loire,Chenin Blanc
2013,86,Drink,"Storms early and late hampered flowering and harvest. Hail ravaged Vouvray midseason, though it affected yields more than quality. Overall, another difficult year, putting a premium on viticulture and selection in the winery. Expect scattered success at best",France,Loire,Chenin Blanc
2012,85,Drink,"A difficult year. April frosts and a cold, rainy weather pattern through July led to lower yields and uneven ripening; an October storm in the western and central part of the valley caused more problems. Sancerre and Pouilly-Fumé relatively spared",France,Loire,Chenin Blanc
2010,94,Drink or hold,"Warm, dry growing season at both ends of the valley, though with pockets of rain around Tours. Wines should be fresher in style than the concentrated 2009s, with brighter acidity; late-harvest Chenins best since 1997",France,Loire,Chenin Blanc

2008,88,Drink,"Humid, gray growing season resulted in grapes struggling to ripen throughout the valley. Harvest stretched late in October, saved by an Indian summer; good botrytis development for Chenin Blanc",France,Loire,Chenin Blanc
